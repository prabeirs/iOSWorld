This game is about a Pinball. The player get to see a view with four buttons - Edit, Replay, Ball remains:5, Score:0.
She gets initially 5 pinballs to be thrown from a height. It should be always above a minimum level. First she should click
the Edit button and create any number of obstacles with some box like sticks in an arbitrary manner. The purpose of these
obstacles is to let the falling pinball hit these obstacles and then fall down farther till it hit the ground level.
When a pinball goes down and falls in a green rotating slot at the bottom then the player gets a score plus and also a free
ball. But when the pinball falls in a red rotating slot at the bottom then the player looses a score (minus) and do not get
a free ball. There is no point or meaningless in the player just trying to let fall the pinballs without creating any obstacles.
Though this is possible and let gather scores and free pinballs too but not useful.
